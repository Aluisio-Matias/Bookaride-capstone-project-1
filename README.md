BOOKARIDE is a transportation booking website that allows users to reserve online and admins (or the business owner) to keep track of all the reservations made by all users in the database. This is my Capstone Project One for Springboard's Software Engineering course. Here's a link to the project deployed: [BOOKARIDE]

## Features

- Users (clients) can register to book online and keep track of all of their reservations. 
- Admin users can keep track of all of the reservations made by all users, and also create or edit reservations for any user (client) in the database. 
- Users receive a text message confirming their booking has been created successfully using the [Twilio API].   
- Allows users and admins to send booking email confirmations to any email using Python. 
- Auto search for an address using the [Mapquest API]
- User authentication.
- Password hashing for secure password storage.

>[BOOKARIDE] app's goal is to make it easier for users and admins
>to administrate their bookings all in one place. 
>Improvements and new features updates will be coming along the way! 

## Tech

BOOKARIDE uses multiple programming languages and a number of open source projects to work properly:

- HTML and CSS for front-end design
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps.
- [Python] for backend and some frontend development.
- 
- [Flask] 
- [jQuery]
-
